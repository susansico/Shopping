Shopping Project

The Shopping Project is a website that sells coffee, chocolate, and olive oil.  It was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

The Shopping Repository contains two folders and 12 files.  The folders are dist, which contains html5shiv.js, a shim that enables styling of HTML5 elements in versions of IE prior to IE9, and images which contains the images for the project.  The files are Shopping.html, Shopping.css, Shopping.js, Shop.html, About.html, Contact.html, Coffee.html, Chocolate.html, Olive-Oil.html, Celebes-Kalossi.html, Checkout.html, and Picturefill.js, a pollyfill for the HTML5 <picture> element.

Shopping is a work in progress. The home page is Shopping.HTML.  What works is clicking on Shop and then Coffee.  All other menu items are placeholders.  Much of the implementation is dynamic as documented in Shopping.js.  The newer code had not yet been documented. On the Coffee page, the user can add items to the shopping cart.  To speed up the implementation process, the same coffee product was used for all three items.
